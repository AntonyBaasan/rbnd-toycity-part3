1) How long did you spend working on this project?
    About an hour and half

2) What was the most rewarding challenge you conquered?
    So far it is pretty clear.
    
3) What two additional features did you build? Why?
    - Override "==" operator to make available to use "include?" method (by fields)
    - Search transaction by customer and product 
    
4) Where do you still have room to grow?
    - Use Inheritence? I have no idea where to use it, please tell me detailed explanation
        (detail: Let me explain more above. So I see that Customer, Product and Transaction have common logics.
        Do you see any opportunities to have parent class for these classes, that would improve the code?)
